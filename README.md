# Computer Science 15

Hello all! My name is Nathan Forsyth and I am a computer science teacher in Alberta. This repository contains all of the resources I use to teach Computer Science 15. It covers the following modules:
* [CSE 1010 - Computer Science 1](/CSE%201010%20-%20Computer%20Science%201/)
* [CSE 1110 - Structured Programming 1](/CSE%201110%20-%20Structured%20Programming%201/)
* [CSE 1120 - Structured Programming 2](/CSE%201120%20-%20Structured%20Programming%202/)
* [CSE 1210 - Client Side Scripting 1](/CSE%201210%20-%20Client%20Side%20Scripting%201/)
* [CSE 1910 - CSE Project A](/CSE%201910%20-%20CSE%20Project%20A/)

The resources contained in this repository focus on Python, as well as HTML and CSS for the Client Side Scripting 1 module. Future repositories will also be created for a 25 level and 35 level course, and will also focus on Python.

My intention is to focus on a single programming language rather than branching into multiple languages such as C++ for Arduino, Java for Processing, C# for Unity, or JavaScript for web development. Teaching several languages within a single course has consistently led students to fixate on syntax differences and language-specific quirks. As a result, they are often unable to engage deeply with the core programming concepts that the Alberta CTS curriculum is designed to support. Python is intuitive, allows students to focus on logic rather than low level programming concepts, runs on most machines, has wide community support, has many interesting libraries, and is continuously being improved.
