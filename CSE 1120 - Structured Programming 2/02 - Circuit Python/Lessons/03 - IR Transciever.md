# Overview
The IR Transciever built into the CircuitPlayground Express allows for wireless communication between multiple CircuitPlayground Express devices. IR is short for Infrared, a wavelength of light that is invisible to the naked eye. IR communication must have line of sight and only has a range of around 10-20 meters.
