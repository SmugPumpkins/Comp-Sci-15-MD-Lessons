# Python - CircuitPlayground Express - Planning
## Overview
Plan something phenomenal using the CircuitPlayground Express and Python. Your project will need to be planned, tested, and presented to the class to demonstrate your understanding of structured programming. Be sure to focus on using `selection` and `iteration` structures to make your project work.
## Project Criteria
Your task is to:
* Plan a project using the CircuitPlayground Express and Python.
* Identify at least 3 input devices that you would like to use for your project. Input devices can include, but are not limited to:
    * A Button
    * B Button
    * Switch
    * Capacitive Touch
    * Light Sensor
    * Accelerometer
    * Temperature
* Plan how you would like to use the built in Neopixels.
* Plan hw to use the built in speaker.
* Use IPO charts to break down the input, process steps, and output for different modules in your project.
* Use pseudocode or a structured flow chart to communicate the flow of your overall program.
## Outcome Criteria
1. Demonstrate the ability to plan for structured programming challenges that incorporate selection and iteration structures
    1. Determine whether a problem can be solved with an algorithm using the input–process–output (IPO) model.
    2. Decide if the problem contains more than one IPO module.
    3. Break the problem into smaller modules and identify the input, processing, and output for each.
    4. Identify what data the program already has, what data the user must provide, and group those inputs logically using suitable control structures.
    5. Identify the processing steps needed for the solution and group them logically using suitable control structures.
    6. Use common algorithm patterns when needed, such as accumulation or finding maximum/minimum values.
    7. Identify the required outputs and group them logically using suitable control structures.
    8. Arrange all inputs, processes, and outputs in a logical order so that processing only happens when all needed data is available, and output only happens after processing is complete.
    9. Write the final algorithm in a clear, standard format (e.g., pseudocode or a structured chart).
