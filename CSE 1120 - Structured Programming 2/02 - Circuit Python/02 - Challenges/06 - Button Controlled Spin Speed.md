# Challenge - Button Controlled Spin Speed
This challenge explores using the built in buttons and built in Neopixels.
## Mild 🌶️
When a button is pressed it is `True` and is otherwise false. Each Neopixel can be controlled individually. Have a single Neopixel spin continuously counter clockwise *(if you would prefer to have multiple neopixels that is also okay)*.

When Button A is `True`:
* Set the Neopixel spin speed to a fast speed.

When Button B is `True`:
* Set the Neopixel spin speed to a slow speed.

## Medium 🌶️🌶️
When a button is pressed it is `True` and is otherwise false. Each Neopixel can be controlled individually. Have a single Neopixel spin continuously counter clockwise *(if you would prefer to have multiple neopixels that is also okay)*. 

When Button A is `True`:
* Increase the speed of the spinning by a set amount.
* Prevent the program from speeding it up too much if the button is held down for multiple consecutive frames.

When Button B is `True`:
* Decrease the speed of the spinning by a set amount.
* Prevent the program from slowing it down too much if the button is held down for multiple consecutive frames.

## Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️
When a button is pressed it is `True` and is otherwise false. Each Neopixel can be controlled individually. Have a single Neopixel spin continuously counter clockwise *(if you would prefer to have multiple neopixels that is also okay)*.

When Button A is `True`:
* Increase the speed of the spinning by a set amount.
* Prevent the program from speeding it up too much if the button is held down for multiple consecutive frames.

When Button B is `True`:
* Decrease the speed of the spinning by a set amount.
* Prevent the program from slowing it down too much if the button is held down for multiple consecutive frames.

When the spin speed is positive:
* Have the Neopixels spin counter clockwise.

When the spin speed is negative:
* Have the Neopixels spin clockwise.
