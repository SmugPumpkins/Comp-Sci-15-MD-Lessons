# Python - CircuitPlayground Express - Program
## Overview
Create something phenomenal using the CircuitPlayground Express and Python. Your project will need to be planned, tested, and presented to the class to demonstrate your understanding of structured programming. Be sure to focus on using `selection` and `iteration` structures to make your project work.
## Project Criteria
Your task is to:
* Create a project using the CircuitPlayground Express and Python.
* Use *at least 3* input devices in your project. Input devices can include, but are not limited to:
    * A Button
    * B Button
    * Switch
    * Capacitive Touch
    * Light Sensor
    * Accelerometer
    * Temperature
* Use the built in Neopixels
* Use the built in speaker
## Outcome Criteria
* **2 Demonstrate the ability to take an algorithm and convert it to a programming language. Run the program and see the results.**
    * **2.1** Maintain a clear input–process–output (IPO) structure in the algorithm.
    * **2.2** Include appropriate internal and external documentation. This can include comments in your code that explain how it works and planning you’ve done previously.
    * **2.3** Use basic data types correctly (integer, real/float, character, string, Boolean).
    * **2.4** Use variables and constants appropriately to store data.
    * **2.5** Use literals (setting values manually or assigning them to variables in the code) and input commands (allowing the user to set values through input or interaction) to supply data for processing.
    * **2.6** Use the appropriate operators to work with data (for example, assigning values, doing math, comparing values, combining text, or inserting values into strings, etc.) whenever the task requires it.
    * **2.7** Use common algorithm patterns when needed, such as accumulation or finding maximum/minimum values.
    * **2.8** Use suitable selection and looping structures to avoid unconditional jumps, including:
        * **2.8.1** nested conditional blocks
        * **2.8.2** nested loops
    * **2.9** Use output commands (methods or operators) to display results in a clear, formatted way.
* **3 Run the program. Determine if there are any errors and fix them so that the program runs as expected.**
    * **3.1** Use suitable test data to check the program. This can include user inputs or literals that you manually program to check if things work as expected.
        * **3.1.1** Use debugging techniques to track and correct run-time or syntax errors. These are errors that occur when a program will not run at all until the code is correct.
        * **3.1.2** Use debugging techniques to find and fix logic errors. These are errors where the code does run, but produces an unexpected result due to the logic used in the program.

| Outcome| **5 – Mastery of Skill** | **4 – Excellence in Skill**| **3 – Proficiency in Skill**| **2 – Attempting Skill**| **1 – Starting to Attempt Skill** | **0 – Refusal to Engage with Skill**       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **2.1 Maintain a clear IPO structure in the program**                    | IPO structure is explicitly planned, consistently maintained, and refined; structure supports easy modification, expansion, and debugging.      | Program is clearly planned and structured around IPO; inputs, processing, and outputs are easy to identify and logically separated throughout the code. | IPO structure is clear and mostly consistent, with minor overlap between stages.           | IPO structure is attempted but unclear or inconsistently applied.      | IPO structure is largely missing or incorrect.     | No identifiable IPO structure.             |
| **2.2 Include appropriate internal and external documentation**          | Documentation demonstrates expert understanding; comments explain *why* decisions were made, and planning clearly informs final implementation. | Code is thoroughly commented; comments clearly explain purpose, logic, and decisions. External planning is complete and clearly followed.               | Code includes clear and useful comments; external planning is present and mostly followed. | Few comments are present or comments restate code without explanation. | Minimal or ineffective documentation.              | No documentation or planning provided.     |
| **2.3 Use data types correctly**                                         | Data types are selected deliberately for clarity, efficiency, and correctness; conversions and edge cases are handled intentionally.            | Data types are chosen intentionally and used correctly throughout, including correct handling of sensor data and Boolean logic.                         | Data types are used correctly with only minor inefficiencies.                              | Frequent confusion between data types causes limitations or errors.    | Data types are largely incorrect or misunderstood. | No meaningful use of data types.           |
| **2.4 Use variables and constants to store data correctly**              | Variables and constants are named meaningfully, scoped appropriately, and structured to support readability and future changes.                 | Variables and constants are well-named, meaningful, and used consistently; constants are used where appropriate.                                        | Variables are named clearly and used correctly, with minor inconsistencies.                | Variables are used inconsistently or redundantly.                      | Limited or incorrect use of variables.             | No meaningful use of variables.            |
| **2.5 Use literals and external input to provide data for processing**   | Inputs are combined creatively and efficiently to enable flexible, user-driven behavior; design scales beyond minimum requirements.             | Program effectively combines literals and multiple input devices to control behavior in meaningful ways.                                                | Uses literals and input devices correctly with clear purpose.                              | Limited or repetitive use of input devices.                            | Minimal interaction or ineffective use of input.   | No input or interaction used.              |
| **2.6 Use operators to work with data correctly**                        | Operators are used precisely and intentionally; logic is concise, readable, and optimized for the task.                                         | Operators are used accurately and efficiently for comparisons, calculations, and logic throughout the program.                                          | Operators are used correctly with only minor inefficiencies.                               | Frequent operator errors affect program behavior.                      | Major misunderstandings of operators.              | No meaningful operator use.                |
| **2.7 Use common algorithm patterns when needed**                        | Algorithm patterns are selected strategically, combined where appropriate, and adapted to solve non-trivial problems.                           | Algorithm patterns (loops, accumulation, comparisons) are used intentionally and effectively to solve problems.                                         | Appropriate patterns are used correctly with minor limitations.                            | Patterns are attempted but poorly implemented.                         | Little evidence of algorithmic thinking.           | No algorithm patterns used.                |
| **2.8 Use selection and iteration structures**                           | Selection and iteration are used fluently, including purposeful nesting; structures improve clarity, efficiency, and control flow.              | Program uses multiple selection and loop structures effectively, including nested conditionals or loops where appropriate.                              | Selection and loops are used correctly and logically.                                      | Limited or incorrect use of selection or loops.                        | Minimal use or incorrect structure.                | No selection or iteration structures used. |
| **2.9 Use output commands to display results clearly**                   | Output is polished, responsive, and intentional; user feedback is immediate and clearly tied to program state.                                  | Output (Neopixels, sound, serial output) is clear, purposeful, and well-formatted for user understanding.                                               | Output is clear and communicates results effectively.                                      | Output is inconsistent or confusing.                                   | Output is minimal or unclear.                      | No output produced.                        |
| **3.1 Use suitable test data to ensure the program works as intended**   | Testing is systematic and thorough; results are analyzed and used to meaningfully improve program design.                                       | Program is thoroughly tested using varied inputs; testing clearly informed improvements.                                                                | Program is tested with multiple inputs to verify behavior.                                 | Limited testing; issues remain unresolved.                             | Minimal or ineffective testing.                    | No testing evident.                        |
| **3.1.1 Use debugging techniques to correct run-time and syntax errors** | Independently and efficiently diagnoses errors using tools, reasoning, and iteration; errors are prevented through design choices.              | Independently identifies and fixes syntax and run-time errors using systematic debugging strategies.                                                    | Fixes most errors with minimal guidance.                                                   | Struggles to identify or fix errors.                                   | Rarely attempts to debug.                          | Makes no attempt to debug.                 |
| **3.1.2 Use debugging techniques to correct logic errors**               | Anticipates, isolates, and resolves logic errors through deliberate testing and reasoning; demonstrates strong problem-solving habits.          | Effectively diagnoses and corrects logic errors through testing, observation, and revision.                                                             | Identifies and fixes most logic errors with guidance.                                      | Has difficulty identifying logic errors.                               | Does not meaningfully address logic errors.        | Makes no attempt to debug logic errors.    |
