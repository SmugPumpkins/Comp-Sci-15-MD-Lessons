# Python - CircuitPlayground Express - Sharing
## Overview
Share something phenomenal using the CircuitPlayground Express and Python. Your project will need to be planned, tested, and presented to the class to demonstrate your understanding of structured programming. Be sure to focus on using `selection` and `iteration` structures to make your project work.
## Project Criteria
Your task is to:
* Share the project you built with CircuitPlayground Express and Python.
* Demonstrate how users can interact with the project.
* Explain your program:
    * Explain the IPO modules your project includes:
        * Explain the inputs you chose to use.
        * Explain how data from the inputs are processed.
        * Explain how the CircuitPlayground Express outputs to the user.
    * Explain how you used selection control structures.
    * Explain how you used iteration control structures.
## Outcome Criteria
* **2 Demonstrate the ability to take an algorithm and convert it to a programming language. Run the program and see the results.**
    * **2.1** Maintain a clear input–process–output (IPO) structure in the algorithm.
    * **2.5** Use literals (setting values manually or assigning them to variables in the code) and input commands (allowing the user to set values through input or interaction) to supply data for processing.
    * **2.6** Use the appropriate operators to work with data (for example, assigning values, doing math, comparing values, combining text, or inserting values into strings, etc.) whenever the task requires it.
    * **2.8** Use suitable selection and looping structures to avoid unconditional jumps, including:
        * **2.8.1** nested conditional blocks
        * **2.8.2** nested loops
    * **2.9** Use output commands (methods or operators) to display results in a clear, formatted way.
