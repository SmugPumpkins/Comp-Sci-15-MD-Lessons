# Overview
We have now input values, processed values, and output values. That is a large part of the computer science curriculum.

The other large aspects comes from breaking the different processes you will program into modules. In this course, the modules we will be focusing on are functions.

# Important Information
A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called. 

Every function has:
- A name
- the `def` keyword
- a pair of parentesis `()`
- a colon `:` to signify where the block of code begins
- an indented block of code beneath it

Code defined in a function is reusable, and can be added in the program as many times as the user sees fit.

Let's look at an example of a function definition.
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
