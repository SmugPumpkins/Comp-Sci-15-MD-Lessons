# Overview
We've taken a brief look at how different variables can have different types, but variables are only really useful to us when we can do something with them.

In this lesson, we will take a closer look at how to do some basic math in python.

We won't do math on variables yet, but this lesson should give you a basic understanding of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in python.

## Addition
When we want to add values in python, we use `+`.

## Subtraction
When we want to subtract values in python, we use `-`.

## Multiplication
When we want to multiply a value in python, we use `*`.

## Division
When we want to divide a value in python, we use `/`.

# Set Up
Create a new python file called `basicmath.py`.

# Copy
