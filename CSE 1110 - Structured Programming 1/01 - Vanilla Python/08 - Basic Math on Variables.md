# Important Information
To do math with a variable in python, the variable always needs to be declared. When we give a variable a name and a value, this is called declaring the variable. A variable cannot be used until it has been declared.

Later, when we want to change the value of the variable, we call it __assigning__ a value to the variable. A variable can be assigned a new value as often as needed and as many times as needed.
