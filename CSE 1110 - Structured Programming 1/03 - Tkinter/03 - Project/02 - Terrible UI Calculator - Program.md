# Python - Terrible UI Calculator - Program
## Overview
In the time that we have been using Tkinter, you've probably noticed that the graphics aren't impressive. Why not consider that a feature instead of a bug? Why not lean into the ugly and create a calculator with a terrible UI? 

A great place to find inspiration for a terrible UI is [GoulartNogueira/BadUI](https://goulartnogueira.github.io/BadUI/).

## Project Criteria
Your task is to use python and Tkinter to create a terrible calculator UI. The calculator may be a regular arithmetic calculator or a custom kind of calculator (like sport stats or triangle angles or something).

Your project must include the following:
* At least 10 input widgets.
* The use of styles to customize the appearance of widgets.
* At least 1 label that is used for outputting data.
* At least 3 functions that accept parameters.
* At least 3 functions that return values.
* At least 6 total functions.

## Outcome Criteria
