* No more than 300 words in length.
* Convince me that you have met the required outcomes for different steps of the project.
* Reference specific learning outcomes that you feel you exemplified.

| **2.2 Explain why you use an IDE.**                                                                                                 | Clearly and insightfully explains why an IDE is used, comparing it to alternatives and connecting it directly to personal workflow and efficiency. | Clearly explains why an IDE is used and how it supports programming tasks.                                       | Gives a basic, accurate reason for using an IDE.                                       | Explanation is vague or partially incorrect.                            | Shows very limited understanding of why an IDE is used.             | Makes no attempt to explain IDE usage.                        |
