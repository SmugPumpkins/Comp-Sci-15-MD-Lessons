# Python - Terrible UI Calculator - Planning
## Overview
In the time that we have been using Tkinter, you've probably noticed that the graphics aren't impressive. Why not consider that a feature instead of a bug? Why not lean into the ugly and create a calculator with a terrible UI? 

A great place to find inspiration for a terrible UI is [GoulartNogueira/BadUI](https://goulartnogueira.github.io/BadUI/).

## Project Criteria
Your task is to use python and Tkinter to create a terrible calculator UI. The calculator may be a regular arithmetic calculator or a custom kind of calculator (like sport stats or triangle angles or something).

Your project must include the following:
* At least 10 input widgets.
* The use of styles to customize the appearance of widgets.
* At least 1 label that is used for outputting data.
* At least 3 functions that accept parameters.
* At least 3 functions that return values.
* At least 6 total functions.

Your planning must include:
* A description and explanation for how this project relates to algorithms.
* Sketches of the UI layout you plan to create.
* IPO Charts for each of your functions.
* Either pseudocode or a flow chart to outline the overall control flow of your program.
    * *Note: I would recommend a **flow chart** for this project, as it will make it significantly easier to map out the control flow of events triggering things!*
## Outcome Criteria
* **1 Demonstrate introductory structured programming skills by planning and writing sequential algorithms.**
  * **1.1** Explain what an algorithm is and why it is used.
  * **1.2** Analyze simple algorithms and describe the task or tasks they perform.
  * **1.3** Determine whether a problem can be solved using an input–process–output (IPO) approach.
  * **1.4** Break a problem into input, processing, and output components.
  * **1.5** Identify which data is already available to the program and which data must be provided as input.
  * **1.6** Arrange inputs, processing steps, and outputs in the correct order so that:
    * **1.6.1** processing occurs only after all required input is available
    * **1.6.2** output occurs only after processing is complete
  * **1.7** Write algorithms in a clear, standard format.
  * **1.8** Test algorithms using appropriate data.
  * **1.9** Revise and improve algorithms based on testing results.
