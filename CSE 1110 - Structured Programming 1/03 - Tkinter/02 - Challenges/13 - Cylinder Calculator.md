# Challenge - Cylinder Calculator
The object of this challenge is to practice adding event bindings to a Tkinter program.

## Mild 🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `diameter` of a cylinder
* There is a labeled input field for the `height` of a cylinder
* There is a function that uses the `diameter` and `height` to calculate the `volume` of the cylinder
* A button to call the function
* A label to display the `volume`

## Medium 🌶️🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `diameter` of a cylinder
* There is a labeled input field for the `height` of a cylinder
* There is a function that uses the `diameter` and `height` to calculate the `surface_area` of the cylinder
* A button to call the function
* A label to display the `surface_area`

## Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️

Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `diameter` of a cylinder
* There is a labeled input field for the `height` of a cylinder
* There is a function that uses the `diameter` and `height` to calculate the `surface_area` of the cylinder
* There is a function that uses the `diameter` and `height` to calculate the `volume` of the cylinder
* A button to call the `volume` function
* A button to call the `surface_area` function
* A label to display the `volume`
* A label to display the `surface_area`
* A button to calculate both `volume` and `surface_area`
