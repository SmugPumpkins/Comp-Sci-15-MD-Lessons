# Challenge - SOH CAH TOA Calculator
The object of this challenge is to practice adding event bindings to a Tkinter program.

## Mild 🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `opposite` length of a triangle.
* There is a labeled input field for the `hypotenuse` length of a triangle.
* There is a `SOH` function that uses the `opposite` and `hypotenuse` to calculate the `angle` of the triangle in degrees.
* A button to call the function
* A label to display the `angle`

## Medium 🌶️🌶️
Create **three separate programs**, each focused on a single trigonometric ratio (**SOH**, **CAH**, or **TOA**). Each program must satisfy the requirements listed for its assigned ratio.
* **Program 1**
  * There is a labeled input field for the `opposite` length of a triangle.
  * There is a labeled input field for the `hypotenuse` length of a triangle.
  * There is a `SOH` function that uses the `opposite` and `hypotenuse` to calculate the `angle` of the triangle in degrees.
  * There is a button that calls the `SOH` function.
  * There is a label to display the calculated `angle`.

* **Program 2**
  * There is a labeled input field for the `adjacent` length of a triangle.
  * There is a labeled input field for the `hypotenuse` length of a triangle.
  * There is a `CAH` function that uses the `adjacent` and `hypotenuse` to calculate the `angle` of the triangle in degrees.
  * There is a button that calls the `CAH` function.
  * There is a label to display the calculated `angle`.

* **Program 3**
  * There is a labeled input field for the `opposite` length of a triangle.
  * There is a labeled input field for the `adjacent` length of a triangle.
  * There is a `TOA` function that uses the `opposite` and `adjacent` to calculate the `angle` of the triangle in degrees.
  * There is a button that calls the `TOA` function.
  * There is a label to display the calculated `angle`.

## Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `opposite` length of a triangle.
* There is a labeled input field for the `hypotenuse` length of a triangle.
* There is a labeled input field for the `adjacent` length of a triangle.
* There is a `SOH` function that uses the `opposite` and `hypotenuse` to calculate the `angle` of the triangle in degrees.
* There is a `CAH` function that uses the `adjacent` and `hypotenuse` to calculate the `angle` of the triangle in degrees.
* There is a `TOA` function that uses the `opposite` and `adjacent` to calculate the `angle` of the triangle in degrees.
* 3 buttons, one to call each function separately
* A label to display the `angle`
