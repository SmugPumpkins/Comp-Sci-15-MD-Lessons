# Challenge - Triangle Calculator
The object of this challenge is to practice adding event bindings to a Tkinter program.

## Mild 🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `base` length of a triangle
* There is a labeled input field for the `height` of a triangle
* There is a function that uses `base` and `height` as parameters and returns the `area` of a triangle
* A button to call the function
* A label to display the calculated triangle `area`

## Medium 🌶️🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `base` length of a triangle
* There is a labeled input field for the `height` of a triangle
* There is a combobox to select units
* There is a function that uses `base` and `height` as parameters and returns the `area` of a triangle
* A button to call the function
* A label to display the calculated triangle `area` with units


## Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️

Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `base` length of a triangle
* There is a labeled input field for the `height` of a triangle
* There is a combobox to select units
* There is a function that uses `base` and `height` as parameters and returns the `area` of a triangle
* A button to call the function
* A label to display the calculated triangle `area` with units
* Pressing `Enter` in either input field triggers the same calculation as the button
