# Challenge - Slope Calculator
The object of this challenge is to practice adding event bindings to a Tkinter program.

## Mild 🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the change in `x` of a slope
* There is a labeled input field for the change in `y` of a slope
* There is a function that uses the change in `x` and `y` to calculate the slope
* A button to call the function
* A label to display the slope of the line

## Medium 🌶️🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for `x1`
* There is a labeled input field for `y1`
* There is a labeled input field for `x2`
* There is a labeled input field for` y2`
* There is a function that uses (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`) to calculate the slope of the line
* A button to call the function
* A label to display the slope of the line

## Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️

Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for `x1`
* There is a labeled input field for `y1`
* There is a labeled input field for `x2`
* There is a labeled input field for `y2`
* There is a function that uses (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`) to calculate the y-intercept (`b`) of the line using the formula `y = mx + b`
* A button to call the function
* A label to display the y-intercept (`b`)
* Pressing `Enter` in either input field triggers the same calculation as the button
