# Challenge - Physics Calculator
The object of this challenge is to practice adding event bindings to a Tkinter program.

## Mild 🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `distance` an object has travelled
* There is a labeled input field for the `time` it took the object to travel that far
* There is a function that uses the `distance` and `time` to calculate the `velocity` of the object
* A button to call the function
* A label to display the `velocity`

## Medium 🌶️🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `distance_1` an object has travelled
* There is a labeled input field for the `time_1` it took the object to travel that far
* There is a labeled input field for the `distance_2` an object has travelled
* There is a labeled input field for the `time_2` it took the object to travel that far
* There is a function that uses `distance` and `time` to calculate `velocity`
  * `velocity = distance / time`
* There is a function that uses `velocity_1`, `velocity_2`, `time_1`, and `time_2` to calculate `acceleration`
  * `acceleration = (velocity_2 - velocity_1) / (time_2 - time_1)`
* A button to calculate `acceleration`
* A label to display the calculated `acceleration`

## Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️
Create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* There is a labeled input field for the `distance_1` an object has travelled
* There is a labeled input field for the `time_1` it took the object to travel that far
* There is a labeled input field for the `distance_2` an object has travelled
* There is a labeled input field for the `time_2` it took the object to travel that far
* There is a labeled input field for the `mass` of the object
* There is a function that uses `distance` and `time` to calculate `velocity`
  * `velocity = distance / time`
* There is a function that uses `velocity_1`, `velocity_2`, `time_1`, and `time_2` to calculate `acceleration`
  * `acceleration = (velocity_2 - velocity_1) / (time_2 - time_1)`
* There is a function that uses `velocity_1`, `velocity_2`, `time_1`, and `time_2` to calculate `acceleration`
  * `acceleration = (velocity_2 - velocity_1) / (time_2 - time_1)`
* There is a function that uses `mass` and `acceleration` to calculate `force`.
* A button to calculate `force`
* A label to display the calculated `force`
