# Challenge - Recreate the Layout
The object of this challenge is to practice adding elements and layouts using Tkinter.

For these "Recreate the Layout" challenges, I am not so concerned with an exact, pixel for pixel recreation. However, there will be required inclusions listed under each image.

## Mild 🌶️

* There is padding around each widget to create space
