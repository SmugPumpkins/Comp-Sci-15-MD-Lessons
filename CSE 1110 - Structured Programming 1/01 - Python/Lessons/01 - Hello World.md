# Overview
One of the first things you will often do when starting with a new programming language is have your program greet the world! This often serves the purpose of learning how to output a value.

# Set Up
Create a new python file and call it `helloworld.py`. We will learn more about good names for a new file later on in the semester.

# Copy
In python, we print to the terminal with the command `print()`. Copy the following code.
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Run your program. Where do you see "Hello, World!" displayed?

This is called your terminal! When working with text based programs in python, your terminal is where your output shows up! We will also learn how to allow user input through the terminal.

# Change
Let's see if we can change the message so it prints something else the next time we run the program. Have the program print `Hello,` followed by your name instead of `Hello, World!`.

What did you have to change to get these results?

# Challenge
Now that you've changed the code to say something different, can you make it print more than one thing? See if you can get all 3 of the following to output on separate lines the next time you would execute the code:

`Hello, World!`

`Hello, ` followed by your name

`I love computer science!`
