# Challenge - Debug Syntax Errors
The object of this challenge is to practice identifying and debugging syntax errors.

## Mild 🌶️
Copy and run the following code.
```python
def area_of_circle(radius)
    return 3.14 * (radius ** 2

result = area_of_circle(5)
print(result)
```
Debug the code so it still maintains functionality, but does not raise errors.

## Medium 🌶️🌶️
Copy and run the following code.
```python
def fuel_cost(distance, rate)
    cost = distance * rate
        total = cost + 10
    label = "fTotal: {cost}
    print(label))

fuel_cost(8), 4)
```
Debug the code so it still maintains functionality, but does not raise errors.

## Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️
Copy and run the following code.
```python
def loan_payment(principal, rate)
    monthly = principal * rate

def yearly_total(monthly)
    return monthly * 12

        payment = loan_payment(1000, 0.05
annual = yearly_total(payment)
extra fee = annual + 50
    annual_total = annual + extra fee
print("fAnnual total: {annual_total})
```
Debug the code so it still maintains functionality, but does not raise errors.
