# Challenge - Conversion Functions
The object of this challenge is to create functions that can accept arguments and return values.

## Mild 🌶️
Create 3 functions from the following choices:
|Function|Input|Output|
|-|-|-|
|Temperature (°C to °F)|A number representing °C.|The converted value to °F.|
|Temperature (°F to °C)|A number representing °F.|The converted value to °C.|
|Distance (m to ft)|A number representing distance in m.|The converted value to ft.|
|Distance (ft to m)|A number representing distance in ft.|The converted value to m.|
|Mass (kg to lb)|A number representing mass in kg.| The converted value to lb.|
|Mass (lb to kg)|A number representing mass in lb.| The converted value to kg.|

Then create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* For each function you created:
    * The user provides an input.
    * The program uses your function to convert the value.
    * The program outputs a message displaying:
        * The original input number and its units.
        * The converted value and its units.

## Medium 🌶️🌶️
Create 2 functions from the following choices:
|Function|Input|Output|
|-|-|-|
|Temperature (°C to °F)|A number representing °C.|The converted value to °F.|
|Temperature (°F to °C)|A number representing °F.|The converted value to °C.|
|Distance (m to ft)|A number representing distance in m.|The converted value to ft.|
|Distance (ft to m)|A number representing distance in ft.|The converted value to m.|
|Mass (kg to lb)|A number representing mass in kg.| The converted value to lb.|
|Mass (lb to kg)|A number representing mass in lb.| The converted value to kg.|

For each of your functions create 3 tests using `pytest`:
* Each function must have at least one test that `asserts` that 2 values are equal.
* Each function must have at least one test that `asserts` that 2 values are not equal.

Then create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* For each function you created:
    * The user provides an input.
    * The program uses your function to convert the value.
    * The program outputs a message displaying:
        * The original input number and its units.
        * The converted value and its units.

## Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️
Create 4 functions from the following choices:
|Function|Input|Output|
|-|-|-|
|Temperature (°C to °F)|A number representing °C.|The converted value to °F.|
|Temperature (°F to °C)|A number representing °F.|The converted value to °C.|
|Distance (m to ft)|A number representing distance in m.|The converted value to ft.|
|Distance (ft to m)|A number representing distance in ft.|The converted value to m.|
|Mass (kg to lb)|A number representing mass in kg.| The converted value to lb.|
|Mass (lb to kg)|A number representing mass in lb.| The converted value to kg.|

For each of your functions create 3 tests using `pytest`:
* Each function must have at least one test that `asserts` that 2 values are equal.
* Each function must have at least one test that `asserts` that 2 values are not equal.

Then create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* For each function you created:
    * The user provides an input.
    * The program uses your function to convert the value.
    * The program outputs a message displaying:
        * The original input number and its units.
        * The converted value and its units.
