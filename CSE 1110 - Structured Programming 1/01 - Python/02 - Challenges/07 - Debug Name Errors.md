# Challenge - Debug Name Errors
The object of this challenge is to practice identifying and debugging name errors.

## Mild 🌶️
Copy and run the following code.

```python
def paint_required(area, coverage):
    return area * covreage

wall_area = 25
paint_coverage = 10
litres = paint_required(wall_area, paint_coverage)
print(litres)
```

Debug the code so it still maintains functionality, but does not raise errors.

## Medium 🌶️🌶️
Copy and run the following code.

```python
def trip_cost(distance, fuel_cost):
    fuel_used = distance
    return fuel_used * fuel_price

trip_dsitance = 8
distance_km = trip_distance
fuel_cost = 1.25
cost = trip_cost(distance_km, fuel_cost)
taxes = 0.05
total = cost + tax
print(total)
```

Debug the code so it still maintains functionality, but does not raise errors.

## Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️
Copy and run the following code.

```python
def recipe_scaler(original_servings, required_servings, ingredient_amount):
    factor = servings / original_servings
    return factor * ingredients

extra_amount = 3
unit_price = 0.6
scaled_amount = recipe_scaling(3, 4, 1/2)
total_needed = scaled_amount + extra_ingredient
final_price = total_needed * uint_price
print(total_price)
```

Debug the code so it still maintains functionality, but does not raise errors.
