# Challenge - Arithmetic Functions
The object of this challenge is to create functions that can accept arguments and return values.

## Mild 🌶️
Create 2 functions from the following choices:
|Function|Input|Output|
|-|-|-|
|Addition|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The sum of `a` and `b`.|
|Subtraction|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The difference between `a` and `b`.|
|Multiplication|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The product of `a` and `b`.|
|Division|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The quotient of `a` / `b`.|

Then create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* The user provides input `a` and `b`.
* The program uses your first function to calculate a total.
* The program outputs the total and the operation used to get that total.
* The user provides a second input for `a` and `b`.
* The program uses your second function to calculate the total.
* The program outputs the total and the operation used to get that total.

## Medium 🌶️🌶️
Create the 4 following functions:
|Function|Input|Output|
|-|-|-|
|Addition|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The sum of `a` and `b`.|
|Subtraction|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The difference between `a` and `b`.|
|Multiplication|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The product of `a` and `b`.|
|Division|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The quotient of `a` / `b`.|

Then create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* For each function you created:
    * The user provides input `a` and `b`.
    * The program uses your first function to calculate a total.
    * The program outputs the total and the operation used to get that total.

## Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️
Create the 4 following functions:
|Function|Input|Output|
|-|-|-|
|Addition|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The sum of `a` and `b`.|
|Subtraction|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The difference between `a` and `b`.|
|Multiplication|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The product of `a` and `b`.|
|Division|2 numbers, `a` and `b`.|The quotient of `a` / `b`.|

For each of your functions create 2 tests using `pytest`:
* Each function must have one test that `asserts` that 2 values are equal.
* Each function must have one test that `asserts` that 2 values are not equal.

Then create a program that satisfies the following requirements:
* For each function you created:
    * The user provides input `a` and `b`.
    * The program uses your first function to calculate a total.
    * The program outputs the total and the operation used to get that total.
