<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>So now we know how to get the user to input variables, and we&rsquo;ve learned some basic math for python. To make our variables more useful, we can look at how to change them.</p>
<h1>Important Information</h1>
<p>To do math with a variable in python, the variable always needs to be declared. When we give a variable a name and a value, this is called declaring the variable. A variable cannot be used until it has been declared.</p>
<p>Later, when we want to change the value of the variable, we call it <strong>assigning</strong> a value to the variable. A variable can be assigned a new value as often as needed and as many times as needed.</p>
<h2>Assigning with a Literal</h2>
<p>When we want to assign a new value to a variable, we can always just use a literal (when we literally type the value).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Declare the variable.
my_variable = 7

# Assign a new value with a literal
my_variable = 100
</code></pre>
<h2>Assigning with an Expression</h2>
<p>We can also use an expression to assign the value of a variable. The expression can use literals or other variables.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Assigning with a literal expression
my_variable = 50 + 40

# Assigning with a variable as part of the expression
my_second_variable = my_variable + 10

# Assigning with just a variable as the expression
my_third_variable = my_second_variable
</code></pre>
<h2>Assigning By Changing The Variable</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to change the variable by a certain amount. A common case for this is incrementing the variable (increasing it by 1) or decrementing the variable (decreasing it by 1).</p>
<p>To change a variable by a particular amount, you need to use the variable you want to change as part of the expression.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Declaring the variable with a starting value of 0
my_variable = 0

# Increase my_variable by 10
my_variable = my_variable + 10 # new value is 10

# Decrease my_variable by 3
my_variable = my_variable - 3 # new value is 7

# Multiply my variable by 5
my_variable = my_variable * 5 # new value is 35

# Divide my variable by 7
my_variable = my_variable / 7 # new value is 5
</code></pre>
<h2>Assigning with Shorthand</h2>
<p>Changing a variable by a specific amount is a very common thing to do in programming. Because of this, programmers will often use shorthand to program when a value is changing by a specific amount.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Declaring the variable with a starting value of 0
my_variable = 0

# Increase my_variable by 10
my_variable += 10 # new value is 10

# Decrease my_variable by 3
my_variable -= 3 # new value is 7

# Multiply my variable by 5
my_variable *= 5 # new value is 35

# Divide my variable by 7
my_variable /= 7 # new value is 5
</code></pre>
<h1>Set Up</h1>
<p>Create a new file called <code>basicmathvariables.py</code>.</p>
<h1>Copy</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a variable that we will add to and then print.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_number = 100
my_number = my_number + 200
print(my_number)
</code></pre>
<h1>Change</h1>
<p>Make it so that <code>200</code> is added to <code>my_number</code> with shorthand.</p>
<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p>Start with a number.
Add <code>0</code> to it and print it.
Subtract <code>50</code> from it and print it.
Multiply it by <code>17</code> and print it.
Divide it by <code>20</code> and print it.</p>
<h1>Copy</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try one more thing. Run the following code and see what happens (even if you have a red line, try running the code).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_number = 100
my_number += another_number
print(my_number)
</code></pre>
<p>You just discovered a new kind of error! A <code>NameError</code> happens when a variable (or function, which we will learn about later) is used in the code without being declared.</p>
<p>To fix a <code>NameError</code>, all you need to do is make sure the variable is declared before being used in the code.</p>
<h1>Change</h1>
<p>Fix the error so that <code>another_number</code> is declared.</p>
