|1.1 Determine whether the problem can be solved with an IPO model.|||||||
|1.2 Determine if the problem contains more than one IPO module.|||||||
|1.3 Break the problem into smaller modules and identify the IPO model for each.|||||||
|1.4 Identify data that the program will already have and data that will be input from an external source for each IPO module.|||||||
|1.5 Create the steps of the processes required in each of your IPO modules using appropriate control structures for each IPO module.|||||||
|1.6 Use common algorithm patterns when needed.|||||||
|1.7 Identify the required outputs for each IPO module.|||||||
|1.8 Arrange inputs, processes, and outputs in a logical order such that processing only happens when all required data is available, and output only happens after processing is complete.|||||||
|1.9 Write the algorithm in a clear, standard format (pseudocode or a flow chart)|||||||
